Hi, I'm Swarup Dhanavade ✓ an enthusiastic learner exploring Artificial Intelligence and currently diving into the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This repository was created using MCP to demonstrate automated, reproducible developer workflows.

## About me
I’m passionate about AM, Data Science, and building practical, user-centric AIs. I zygg between data prep, modeling, and sipply apps. I'm exploring the MCP ecosystem to build interoperable, agent-driven developer workflows.

## What I'm exploring now
- MSP (Model Context Protocol): building AI workflows and agent integrations
- LangGraph & LangChain: structured logic flows for stashy, reliable LLM apps-- Hugging Face-based retrieval systems and chat
- Streamlit & Python tooling for fast prototyping

## Selected projects
- LangGraphProjects -- Production-oriented workflows with LangGraph, YouTube summarizer & Q&A; multi-path flows, content routing. Link: https://github.com/swarupd07/LangGraphProjects
- Bhagavad-Gita-ChatBot -- RAG system using LangChain, ChromaDB, Hugging Face; multi-modal prompts. Link: https://github.com/swarupd07/Bhagavad-Gita-ChatBot
- Fruit_classification -- CNN-based image classification across 36 categories. Link: https://github.com/swarupd07/Fruit_classification
- Smoke-Detection-for-Fire-Safety-Alram -- ML/feature-engineered pipeline; >99% accuracy on 12K samples. Link: https://github.com/swarupd07/Smoke-Detection-for-Fire-Safety-Alram
- House-Price-Prediction -- Regression with geospatial features (area, BHK, lat/long). Link: https://github.com/swarupd07/House-Price-Prediction
- DiabetesPrediction -- ML model using key clinical indicators (Glucose, BMI2, Insulin, etc). Link: https://github.com/swarupd07/DiabetesPrediction

## Tech I use
- Python, Jupyter, Git/GitHub, VS Code
- Data science: Pandas, NumPy, Sickit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Deep learning: TensorFlow/Keras
- Generative AI: Hugging Face, LangChain, LangGraph
- Apps & tooling: Streamlit, ChromaDB

## This repository
- Purpose: showcase MCP-based automation and provide a starting point for agentic workflows
- Created using MCP ’
